<h1 align="left">Hey there 👋, I'm Dewinda J. Rumala</a></h1>

<!-- <h3 align="center"> 👩‍🎓 PhD Candidate in Computer Science</h3> -->

### 💡 About Me
I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology👩‍🎓 where I specialized in deep learning and medical image analysis. Currently, I work as an AI Research Engineer, focusing on developing and optimizing LLM architectures and techniques👩🏻‍💻

### ✨ My Interests
- 🧮 Deep Learning
- 🧠 Medical Image Analysis
- ⚖️ Fairness in AI
- 🔍 Recently, I’ve been exploring something a bit different—LLMs 📖🤖

### 🕵️‍♀️ Side Research/Project
- ✂️<a href="https://djrumala.github.io/publications/how-you-split-matters" target="blank">How You Split Matters</a>
  - 🔮Beyond my PhD research on advancing deep learning techniques for brain MRI analysis, I took the initiative to independently explore fairness in AI within the context of longitudinal data. This interest came from a mistake I made during one of my experiments. I realized the importance of fairness after noticing a lack of attention to it in AI research in my region, where the focus is often on achieving SOTA results instead
