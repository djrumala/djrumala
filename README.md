<h1 align="left">Hey there 👋, I'm Dewinda J. Rumala</a></h1>

<!-- <h3 align="center"> 👩‍🎓 PhD Candidate in Computer Science</h3> -->

### 💡 About Me
I work remotely as an AI research engineer at a European-based AI startup, focusing on developing cutting-edge methods and frameworks to enhance LLMs in reasoning, adaptability, and efficiency. During my PhD, my research centered around deep learning applications in healthcare, particularly medical image analysis. I have contributed to AI research through publications and by serving as a reviewer for venues such as MICCAI, MIDL, and MIUA.

### ✨ My Interests
- 🧮 Deep Learning
- 🧠 Medical Image Analysis
- ⚖️ Fairness in AI
- 🌏 Open Science & Reproducibility
- 🔍 Recently, I’ve been exploring LLMs 📖🤖


### 🕵️‍♀️ Side Research/Project
- 🔮 <a href="https://djrumala.github.io/publications/how-you-split-matters" target="blank">How You Split Matters</a> [Fairness in AI]
  - Beyond my PhD research on advancing deep learning techniques for brain MRI analysis, I took the initiative to independently explore the study of data leakage and splitting strategies within the context of longitudinal data. I realized the importance of fairness and avoiding such biases after noticing a lack of attention to them in my region.
- 🛠️ <a href="https://github.com/djrumala/ADNI-processing" target="blank">ADNI-processing</a> [Open Science & Reproducibility]
  - A structured, reproducible pipeline for preprocessing ADNI MRI data, including DICOM-to-NIfTI conversion, subject organization, and batch processing with SPM. Designed for scalability and ease of use in neuroimaging research.
