<h1 align="left">Hey there 👋, I'm Dewinda J. Rumala</a></h1>

<!-- <h3 align="center"> 👩‍🎓 PhD Candidate in Computer Science</h3> -->

### About Me
- 👩🏻‍💻 AI Research Engineer
- 👩‍🎓 PhD in Computer Science

### My Interests
- 🧮 Deep Learning, Medical Image Analysis, Fairness in AI
- 🔍 Recently, I’ve been exploring something a bit different—developing and optimizing LLM architectures and techniques 📖🤖

### Side Research/Project
- ⚖️<a href="https://djrumala.github.io/publications/how-you-split-matters" target="blank">How You Split Matters</a>
  -  🧠 Beyond my PhD research on advancing deep learning techniques for brain MRI analysis, I took the initiative to independently explore fairness in AI within the context of longitudinal data. This interest came from a mistake I made during one of my experiments. I realized the importance of fairness after noticing a lack of attention to it in AI research in my region, where the focus is often on achieving SOTA results instead
